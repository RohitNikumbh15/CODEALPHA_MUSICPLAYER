# CODEALPHA_MUSICPLAYER
This project is a web-based music player built using a three-layer architecture:

HTML: Defines the structure and content of the music player interface. CSS: Adds styling to enhance the visual appeal of the player. JavaScript: Implements interactivity, including audio playback and control functionalities, triggered by user actions.

This architecture ensures a clean, responsive, and user-friendly music player design.
